# Action Extraction Reports

This directory contains detailed implementation reports for extracting inline workflow logic into reusable composite actions from the `release-update-flow.yml` workflow.

## Overview

The workflow reorganization involves creating **6 new composite actions** organized into two implementation phases:

- **Phase 1 (High Priority):** 3 actions that provide the most significant complexity reduction
- **Phase 2 (Medium Priority):** 3 actions for additional cleanup and reusability

## Phase 1: High-Priority Extractions

These actions should be implemented first as they provide the most significant benefits:

| # | Action Name | Report | Complexity Reduction | Impact |
|---|-------------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | `check-branch-and-pr-status` | [ðŸ“„ Report](./phase1-high-priority/01-check-branch-and-pr-status.md) | ~40 lines | High |
| 2 | `fetch-base-file` | [ðŸ“„ Report](./phase1-high-priority/02-fetch-base-file.md) | ~80 lines | High |
| 3 | `generate-platform-diff-report` | [ðŸ“„ Report](./phase1-high-priority/03-generate-platform-diff-report.md) | ~200 lines | Very High |

**Phase 1 Total Impact:** ~320 lines reduced, 3 reusable actions created

## Phase 2: Medium-Priority Extractions

These actions provide additional cleanup and should be implemented after Phase 1:

| # | Action Name | Report | Complexity Reduction | Impact |
|---|-------------|--------|---------------------|---------|
| 4 | `calculate-version-increment` | [ðŸ“„ Report](./phase2-medium-priority/04-calculate-version-increment.md) | ~30 lines | Medium |
| 5 | `generate-package-diff-report` | [ðŸ“„ Report](./phase2-medium-priority/05-generate-package-diff-report.md) | ~80 lines | Medium |
| 6 | `build-pr-body` | [ðŸ“„ Report](./phase2-medium-priority/06-build-pr-body.md) | ~40 lines | Low |

**Phase 2 Total Impact:** ~150 lines reduced, 3 additional reusable actions created

## Combined Impact

- **Total Inline Script Reduction:** 560 lines â†’ 60 lines (89% reduction)
- **New Reusable Actions:** 6 actions available for other workflows
- **Workflow Steps:** 25 steps â†’ 20 steps
- **Overall Complexity:** High â†’ Low

## Implementation Sequence

Follow this sequence for optimal results:

1. **Week 1:** Implement actions #1 and #2 (check-branch-and-pr-status, fetch-base-file)
2. **Week 2:** Implement action #3 (generate-platform-diff-report) and integrate Phase 1 actions
3. **Week 3:** Implement actions #4 and #5 (calculate-version-increment, generate-package-diff-report)
4. **Week 4:** Implement action #6 (build-pr-body) and integrate Phase 2 actions
5. **Week 5:** Documentation, testing, and review

## Report Structure

Each action report contains:

- **Overview:** Purpose and context
- **Current Implementation:** Code location and complexity analysis
- **Action Specification:** Detailed inputs, outputs, and interface
- **Implementation Guide:** Step-by-step instructions
- **Code Examples:** Current code and proposed action structure
- **Testing Strategy:** Test scenarios and validation
- **Integration:** How to update the workflow
- **Success Criteria:** How to measure completion

## Getting Started

1. Review the full [Workflow Reorganization Report](../../workflows/workflow-reorganization-report.md)
2. Start with Phase 1, Action #1: [check-branch-and-pr-status](./phase1-high-priority/01-check-branch-and-pr-status.md)
3. Follow the implementation guide in each report
4. Test thoroughly before proceeding to the next action
